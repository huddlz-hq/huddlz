    # Reflection & Learning Extraction

    This command analyzes the development journey and extracts learnings.

    ## Context Gathering

    1. Validate issue parameter:
       - Must have {{ params.issue }} parameter
       - If missing, error with: "Please specify issue: /reflect issue=123"

    2. Read all relevant files:
       - `tasks/issue-{{ params.issue }}/index.md` - Requirements and plan
       - `tasks/issue-{{ params.issue }}/session.md` - Implementation journey
       - `tasks/issue-{{ params.issue }}/learnings.md` - Accumulated insights
       - All task files for specific challenges

    ## Analysis Process

    1. **Journey Analysis**:
       - Original plan vs actual implementation
       - Time estimates vs actual time
       - Unexpected challenges encountered
       - Course corrections made (üîÑ)

    2. **Pattern Recognition**:
       - Recurring challenges across tasks
       - Successful strategies that worked well
       - Anti-patterns to avoid
       - Reusable solutions discovered

    3. **Technical Insights**:
       - Framework-specific learnings
       - Performance considerations found
       - Testing strategies that proved effective
       - Integration patterns

    4. **Process Improvements**:
       - Workflow bottlenecks identified
       - Planning accuracy assessment
       - Task sizing effectiveness
       - Communication gaps
