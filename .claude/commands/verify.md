    # Verification Phase
    
    This command performs comprehensive review and testing of a completed feature implementation.
    
    ## Feature Status Check
    
    1. Fetch parent issue and all sub-issues:
       ```
       gh issue view {{ params.issue }} --json title,body,state,labels
       gh issue list --label "parent-{{ params.issue }}" --json number,title,state
       ```
    
    2. Verify completion status:
       - Count closed vs open sub-issues
       - List any incomplete tasks
       - If not all closed, ask user if they want to proceed
    
    3. Update Feature Log:
       ```markdown
       ### Verification Phase - [Current Date/Time]
       
       Starting comprehensive review of feature implementation.
       Sub-issues completed: [X] of [Y]
       ```
    
    ## Requirements Review
    
    1. Extract original requirements from parent issue
    2. Review each requirement against implementation:
       - ‚úÖ Fully implemented
       - ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially implemented
       - ‚ùå Not implemented
    
    3. Check acceptance criteria:
       - Each criterion met?
       - Edge cases handled?
       - Performance requirements satisfied?
    
    ## Code Quality Review
    
    Analyze the implementation for:
    
    1. **Architecture & Design**:
       - Follows project patterns?
       - Proper separation of concerns?
       - Ash Framework best practices?
    
    2. **Code Quality**:
       - Readable and maintainable?
       - DRY principles followed?
       - Proper error handling?
       - No code smells?
    
    3. **Security**:
       - No hardcoded secrets
       - Proper authorization checks
       - Input validation in place
       - SQL injection prevention
    
    4. **Performance**:
       - No N+1 queries
       - Efficient database access
       - Appropriate indexes
       - Caching where needed
    
    5. **Testing**:
       - Adequate test coverage
       - Tests follow BDD/TDD style
       - Edge cases covered
       - Tests are maintainable
    
    ## Quality Gates (Comprehensive)
    
    Run full test suite:
    ```bash
    # Clean build
    mix clean && mix deps.get && mix compile
    
    # Format check
    mix format --check-formatted
    
    # All tests with coverage
    mix test --cover
    
    # Static analysis
    mix credo --strict
    
    # Feature tests specifically
    mix test test/features/
    
    # Check for warnings
    mix compile --warnings-as-errors
    ```
    
    Document results:
    ```markdown
    ## Quality Gate Results
    
    ‚úÖ **Build**: Clean compilation
    ‚úÖ **Format**: No changes needed
    ‚úÖ **Tests**: [X] passed, 0 failed
    ‚úÖ **Coverage**: [X]% (target: 80%)
    ‚úÖ **Credo**: No issues
    ‚úÖ **Features**: All scenarios passing
    ‚úÖ **Warnings**: None
    ```
    
    ## Integration Testing
    
    Beyond unit tests:
    1. Run the application: `mix phx.server`
    2. Test the feature end-to-end
    3. Verify UI components work correctly
    4. Check for regressions in related features
    5. Test with different user roles
