## Basic Relationship Types

### Has Many Relationships

A has_many relationship indicates that one resource can have multiple instances of another resource.

#### Defining Has Many Relationships

```elixir
# In the Category resource
relationships do
  has_many :articles, Helpcenter.KnowledgeBase.Article do
    description "Relationship with the articles."
    # Specify foreign key column in the destination table
    destination_attribute :category_id
  end
end
```

### Belongs To Relationships

A belongs_to relationship is the inverse of has_many, defined on the child resource.

#### Defining Belongs To Relationships

```elixir
# In the Article resource
relationships do
  belongs_to :category, Helpcenter.KnowledgeBase.Category do
    source_attribute :category_id
  end
end
```

#### Configuring Belongs To in Actions

The simplest way to manage belongs_to relationships is to include the foreign key in the acceptable attributes:

```elixir
# In the Article resource
actions do
  default_accept [
    :title,
    :slug,
    :content,
    :views_count,
    :published,
    :category_id  # Added for category relationship
  ]

  defaults [:create, :read, :update, :destroy]
end
```

### Has One Relationships

A has_one relationship is similar to belongs_to, except the reference attribute is on the destination resource instead of the source.

```elixir
# In User resource
relationships do
  has_one :profile, MyApp.Profiles.Profile do
    destination_attribute :user_id
  end
end
```

For detailed information, refer to the [official documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/ash/relationships.html#has-one).

### Many-to-Many Relationships

Many-to-many relationships in Ash are implemented using a join resource/table.

#### Defining Many-to-Many Relationships

```elixir
# In the Article resource
many_to_many :tags, Helpcenter.KnowledgeBase.Tag do
  through Helpcenter.KnowledgeBase.ArticleTag
  source_attribute_on_join_resource :article_id
  destination_attribute_on_join_resource :tag_id
end
```

This defines a relationship that:
- Goes through the ArticleTag join resource
- Uses article_id in the join resource to link to the source (Article)
- Uses tag_id in the join resource to link to the destination (Tag)

## Creating Related Data

### Creating Children from Parent

To create related data (articles under a category):

1. Define a custom action in the parent resource:

```elixir
# In the Category resource
actions do
  update :create_article do
    description "Create an article under a specified category"
    # Set atomic to false for multi-step operations
    require_atomic? false
    # Specify parameter for article attributes
    argument :article_attrs, :map, allow_nil?: false
    change manage_relationship(:article_attrs, :articles, type: :create)
  end
end
```

2. Ensure the child resource (Article) accepts create actions:

```elixir
# In the Article resource
actions do
  default_accept [:title, :slug, :content, :views_count, :published]
  defaults [:create, :read, :update, :destroy]
end
```

3. Create an article under a category:

```elixir
# Get the category first
category = Ash.read_first!(Helpcenter.KnowledgeBase.Category)

# Prepare article data
article_attrs = %{
  title: "Getting Started with Zippiker",
  slug: "getting-started-zippiker",
  content: "Learn how to set up your Zippiker account and configure basic settings.",
  views_count: 1452,
  published: true
}

# Create article under the category
category
|> Ash.Changeset.for_update(:create_article, %{article_attrs: article_attrs})
|> Ash.update()
```

### Creating Parent from Child

To create both the child (Article) and parent (Category) simultaneously:

1. Define an action on the child resource:

```elixir
# In the Article resource
create :create_with_category do
  description "Create an article and its category at the same time"
  argument :category_attrs, :map, allow_nil?: false
  change manage_relationship(:category_attrs, :category, type: :create)
end
```

2. Execute the action:

```elixir
attributes = %{
  title: "Common Issues During Setup and How to Fix Them",
  slug: "setup-common-issues",
  content: "Troubleshooting guide for common challenges faced.",
  category_attrs: %{
    name: "Troubleshooting",
    slug: "troubleshooting",
    description: "Diagnose and fix identified issues"
  }
}

Helpcenter.KnowledgeBase.Article
|> Ash.Changeset.for_create(:create_with_category, attributes)
|> Ash.create()
```

### Creating Both Together

To create a category and its article simultaneously:

1. Define a custom create action in the parent resource:

```elixir
# In the Category resource
create :create_with_article do
  description "Create a Category and an article under it"
  argument :article_attrs, :map, allow_nil?: false
  change manage_relationship(:article_attrs, :articles, type: :create)
end
```

2. Execute the action:

```elixir
# Define attributes for both category and article
attributes = %{
  name: "Features",
  slug: "features",
  description: "Category for features",
  article_attrs: %{
    title: "Compliance Features in Zippiker",
    slug: "compliance-features-zippiker",
    content: "Overview of compliance management features built into Zippiker."
  }
}

# Create both at once
Helpcenter.KnowledgeBase.Category
|> Ash.Changeset.for_create(:create_with_article, attributes)
|> Ash.create()
```

### Working with Many-to-Many

To create an article with tags:

1. Define a custom action in the Article resource:

```elixir
create :create_with_tags do
  description "Create an article with tags"
  argument :tags, {:array, :map}, allow_nil?: false

  change manage_relationship(:tags, :tags,
            on_no_match: :create,
            on_match: :ignore,
            on_missing: :create
          )
end
```

Note the additional options:
- `on_no_match`: What to do when a record doesn't match (create new)
- `on_match`: What to do when a record matches (ignore)
- `on_missing`: What to do when a record is missing (create)

2. Call the action with an array of tag attributes:

```elixir
attributes = %{
  title: "Common Issues During Setup and How to Fix Them",
  slug: "setup-common-issues",
  content: "Troubleshooting guide for common challenges faced.",
  category_id: category.id,
  tags: [%{name: "issues"}, %{name: "solution"}]
}

{:ok, _article} = Helpcenter.KnowledgeBase.Article
  |> Ash.Changeset.for_create(:create_with_tags, attributes)
  |> Ash.create()
```

## Reading Related Data

### Loading Related Resources

To retrieve related data (e.g., articles for a category):

```elixir
category_with_articles =
  Helpcenter.KnowledgeBase.Category
  |> Ash.Query.filter(id == ^category.id)
  |> Ash.Query.load(:articles)  # Tell Ash to load related articles
  |> Ash.read_first!()

# Access articles via
category_with_articles.articles
```

### Filtering with Relationships

Ash allows powerful filtering based on related resources using dot notation.

#### Basic Relationship Filtering

To filter articles by a specific tag:

```elixir
require Ash.Query

Helpcenter.KnowledgeBase.Article
|> Ash.Query.filter(tags.name == "issues")
|> Ash.read!()
```

This returns articles that have the tag "issues".

#### Nested Relationships

You can filter across multiple relationship levels:

```elixir
require Ash.Query

Helpcenter.KnowledgeBase.Category
|> Ash.Query.filter(articles.tags.name == "issues")
|> Ash.read!()
```

This returns categories that have articles with the tag "issues".

The SQL generated for this query would be:

```sql
SELECT
  c0."id",
  c0."name",
  c0."description",
  c0."inserted_at",
  c0."updated_at",
  c0."slug"
FROM "categories" AS c0
 INNER JOIN "articles" AS a1 ON c0."id" = a1."category_id"
 INNER JOIN "article_tags" AS a2 ON a1."id" = a2."article_id"
 INNER JOIN "tags" AS t3 ON t3."id" = a2."tag_id"
WHERE t3."name" = "issues";
```

### Loading Nested Relationships

To load articles and their tags:

```elixir
Helpcenter.KnowledgeBase.Category
|> Ash.Query.filter(articles.tags.name == "issues")
|> Ash.Query.load(articles: :tags)
|> Ash.read!()
```

The special notation `articles: :tags` tells Ash to load articles and then load the tags for each article.

## Deleting Related Records

Ash provides two main approaches for handling the deletion of related records:

### Using Data Layer Constraints

Configure deletion behavior in the postgres section of your resource:

```elixir
# In the Article resource
postgres do
  table "articles"
  repo Helpcenter.Repo

  # Delete this article if related category is deleted
  references do
    reference :category, on_delete: :delete
  end
end
```

Options for `on_delete`:
- `:delete` - Delete related records when the parent is deleted
- `:nilify` - Set foreign key to nil when the parent is deleted
- `:restrict` (default) - Prevent deletion of parent when related records exist

For `:nilify` to work, you also need to allow nil values in the relationship:

```elixir
belongs_to :category, Helpcenter.KnowledgeBase.Category do
  source_attribute :category_id
  # Allow null category_id
  allow_nil? true
end
```

After configuration changes, generate and run migrations:
```
mix ash_postgres.generate_migrations --name add_category_on_delete_to_article
mix ash_postgres.migrate
```

### Using Ash Action Hooks

For more control, you can use hooks to implement custom deletion logic:

```elixir
# In the Article resource
destroy :destroy do
  description "Destroy article and its comments"
  primary? true  # Make this the default destroy action
  require_atomic? false

  # Delete comments before deleting the article
  change before_action(fn changeset, context ->
          require Ash.Query

          # Find and bulk delete all related comments
          %Ash.BulkResult{status: :success} =
            Helpcenter.KnowledgeBase.Comment
            |> Ash.Query.filter(article_id == ^changeset.data.id)
            |> Ash.read!()
            |> Ash.bulk_destroy(:destroy, _condition = %{}, batch_size: 100)

          # Continue with the change
          changeset
        end)
end
```

This approach has some limitations:
- May not guarantee atomicity (all-or-nothing transaction)
- Might not handle deep nested relationships correctly
- May require careful implementation to ensure data integrity

## Key Hooks in Ash

Ash provides several hooks for controlling action workflow:

- `before_action`: Run code before an action starts
- `after_action`: Run code after an action completes
- `before_transaction`: Run code before a transaction starts
- `after_transaction`: Run code after a transaction successfully completes

## Other Common Examples

### Adding Comments to an Article

```elixir
# In the Article resource
update :add_comment do
  description "Add a comment to an article"
  require_atomic? false
  argument :comment, :map, allow_nil?: false
  change manage_relationship(:comment, :comments, type: :create)
end

# Usage
attributes = %{content: "First article content you will see!"}

{:ok, _article} =
  get_article()
  |> Ash.Changeset.for_update(:add_comment, %{comment: attributes})
  |> Ash.update()
```

### Adding Feedback to an Article

```elixir
# In the Article resource
update :add_feedback do
  description "Add a feedback to an article"
  require_atomic? false
  argument :feedback, :map, allow_nil?: false
  change manage_relationship(:feedback, :article_feedbacks, type: :create)
end
```

## Key Insights

1. **Relationship Types**: Ash provides clear patterns for has_many, belongs_to, has_one, and many-to-many relationships.

2. **manage_relationship Change**: This is a key mechanism for working with relationships in Ash:
   - First parameter: The argument that contains the attributes
   - Second parameter: The name of the relationship to manage
   - Third parameter: The options (type: :create, :update, etc.)

3. **Atomic Operations**: Use `require_atomic? false` for multi-step operations.

4. **Loading Related Data**: Use `Ash.Query.load(:relationship_name)` to populate related entities.

5. **Creating Related Records**: Can be done in both directions:
   - Parent → Child: Using manage_relationship in the parent
   - Child → Parent: Using manage_relationship in the child

6. **Arguments in Actions**: Use the `argument` macro to define the structure of inputs to actions.

7. **Relationship Options**: Advanced options like `on_no_match`, `on_match`, and `on_missing` give fine-grained control in many-to-many relationships.

8. **Deletion Strategies**: Choose between data layer constraints and custom hooks for managing related record deletion.
