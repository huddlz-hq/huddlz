# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build/Test Commands

- Setup project: `mix setup`
- Run server: `mix phx.server`
- Run all tests: `mix test`
- Run a single test file: `mix test path/to/test_file.exs`
- Run a specific test: `mix test path/to/test_file.exs:line_number`
- Run Cucumber features: `mix test test/features/`
- Format code: `mix format` (always run before committing changes)
- Run linter: `mix credo --strict` (always run before committing changes)

## Test-Driven Development

This project follows behavior-driven development using Cucumber:
1. Write feature files first in `test/features/` using Gherkin syntax
2. Create step definitions in `test/features/steps/` that test behavior, not implementation
3. Tests should assert what the system does, not how it does it
4. Focus on user-visible outcomes rather than internal implementation details
5. Write the minimal code needed to make tests pass

### Important Testing Guideline

- IMPORTANT: Always implement tests, never skip, comment out, stub, etc... always write good tests they are the backbone of ensuring the code works.

Always test behavior from the user's perspective. Implementation may change, but behavior
tests should remain stable. See docs/testing.md for complete guidelines.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Follow Elixir style conventions with proper spacing and indentation
- Use the pipe operator (`|>`) to chain operations when appropriate
- Modules and functions should have clear, descriptive names in snake_case
- Organize imports: Elixir libraries first, then Phoenix, then project modules
- Write docstrings for public functions with @moduledoc and @doc
- Properly handle errors with pattern matching and descriptive error messages
- Use Phoenix LiveView for interactive UI components
- Implement authentication with AshAuthentication
- Always run `mix format` before committing changes
- **IMPORTANT: Prefer `with` statements over `case` statements for better error handling and readability when handling multiple operations or complex error cases. For single-clause pattern matching, use `case` statements as suggested by Credo**

### Commit Messages

- Follow conventional commits format: `type(scope): concise description`
- Do not include AI attribution lines or AI-generated signatures
- "Co-Authored-By" is reserved for human collaborators only
- Keep first line under 70 characters, no period at the end
- Use imperative, present tense: "add" not "added" or "adds"
- Include a descriptive body with bullet points for specific changes when appropriate
- See `docs/commit-style.md` for complete guidelines

### Naming Conventions

**IMPORTANT: ALWAYS follow these naming conventions precisely**

- A singular event is called a "huddl" (lowercase) - **NEVER** use "event" or any other term
- Multiple events are called "huddlz" (lowercase) - **NEVER** use "events", "huddles", or any other term
- The platform/application name is "huddlz" (lowercase) in all branding, UI copy, and documentation
- In Elixir code, we follow standard conventions:
  - Module names are capitalized (e.g., `Huddlz.Huddls.Huddl`)
  - Variables and function names use snake_case
- When referring to events in comments and documentation, always use lowercase "huddl" and "huddlz"
- This terminology is core to our brand identity and must be maintained consistently

### Group Membership Roles & Access Rules

#### Roles

- `owner`: The creator and primary leader of a group. There is only one owner per group, and the owner must be a verified user.
- `organizer`: Trusted, verified users who help manage the group. There can be multiple organizers per group.
- `member`: Regular participants. Members can be either verified or regular (non-verified) users.

#### Verification

- Only verified users can be assigned as `owner` or `organizer`.
- Verified status is required for elevated permissions and visibility.

#### Access Matrix

| User Type/Role         | Group Type | Can See Members? | Notes                  |
|------------------------|------------|------------------|------------------------|
| owner (verified)       | any        | Yes              |                        |
| organizer (verified)   | any        | Yes              |                        |
| member (verified)      | any        | Yes              |                        |
| member (regular)       | any        | No (count only)  |                        |
| non-member (verified)  | public     | Yes              |                        |
| non-member (verified)  | private    | No               |                        |
| non-member (regular)   | any        | No (count only)  |                        |

#### Policy Summary

- Owners and organizers (must be verified) can always see the full member list for their group.
- Verified members can see the full member list for groups they belong to.
- Regular (non-verified) members and non-members can only see the count of members, not the member list.
- Only verified users can be assigned as owner or organizer.
- When creating a group, the owner must be a verified user.

Refer to `docs/group_membership.md` for a detailed rationale and examples.

## Development Tools

### Technology Stack

This project uses:
- Ash Framework for data modeling and business logic
- Ash Authentication for user authentication
- Phoenix for the web interface and LiveView components

### Tidewave MCP

Always use the Tidewave MCP tools early and often when working with Elixir code:

- `mcp__tidewave__project_eval`: Test and debug Elixir code in the project context
- `mcp__tidewave__get_source_location`: Find where modules and functions are defined
- `mcp__tidewave__execute_sql_query`: Run database queries
- `mcp__tidewave__get_ecto_schemas`: List all available schemas

Using these tools will help you understand code behavior rather than making assumptions.

### Development Patterns

For detailed development patterns and learnings, refer to:

- `docs/development_patterns.md` - Best practices for working with the technology stack
- `docs/development_lifecycle.md` - Complete development workflow from requirements to implementation

These documents contain best practices for:

- Ash Framework authentication flows
- Testing strategies
- Common challenges and solutions
- Feature development workflow
- Knowledge management

## Development Workflow Commands

This project uses custom commands to maintain consistent development practices and knowledge capture. Commands are defined in `.claude/commands/` directory.

### Core Workflow Commands

The development workflow combines GitHub Issues for tracking with local files for rich context. This hybrid approach provides the best of both worlds: public visibility and detailed documentation.

1. **`/plan`** - Requirements Analysis & Task Breakdown
   - **Role**: Project Manager
   - **Objective**: Understand requirements and break down into manageable tasks
   - **Usage**: `/plan issue=123`
   - **Output**: Creates local task structure at `tasks/issue-123/` and feature branch
   - **Creates**: index.md (plan), session.md (notes), tasks/ directory, learnings.md

2. **`/build`** - Implementation with TDD/BDD
   - **Role**: Expert Engineer
   - **Objective**: Meticulously implement code following test-driven development
   - **Usage**: `/build issue=123` (auto-detects next task) or `/build issue=123 task=2` (specific task)
   - **Features**:
     - Reads from local task files for requirements
     - Auto-finds next pending task if not specified
     - Updates session.md with real-time progress
     - Captures course corrections with ðŸ”„ emoji
     - Enforces quality gates before completion
     - Requires human verification between tasks

3. **`/sync`** - GitHub Progress Updates
   - **Role**: Communication Bridge
   - **Objective**: Keep GitHub issue updated with local progress
   - **Usage**: `/sync issue=123` or `/sync issue=123 message="Custom update"`
   - **Updates**: Posts progress summary to GitHub issue

4. **`/verify`** - Code Review & Quality Assurance
   - **Role**: Senior Engineer/Reviewer
   - **Objective**: Critical review, testing, and quality validation
   - **Usage**: `/verify issue=123`
   - **Output**: Verification report in session.md, summary to GitHub

5. **`/reflect`** - Learning Extraction & Process Improvement
   - **Role**: QA Engineer/Process Analyst
   - **Objective**: Analyze journey, extract learnings, improve process
   - **Usage**: `/reflect issue=123`
   - **Updates**: Creates local learnings.md, updates global LEARNINGS.md, prepares PR

### Quality Gates

**IMPORTANT**: All code must pass quality gates before any commit or completion:

1. **Code Formatting**: `mix format` - Must have zero formatting changes
2. **All Tests Pass**: `mix test` - Must have 100% pass rate, no skipped tests
3. **Static Analysis**: `mix credo --strict` - Must pass with zero issues
4. **Feature Tests**: `mix test test/features/` - All behavior tests must pass
5. **Visual Verification**: Use Puppeteer to confirm features work in browser
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:4000` (ensure `mix phx.server` is running)
   - Test the implemented feature visually
   - Especially important when tests are failing - verify implementation BEFORE debugging tests
   - Document any UI/UX issues discovered

The `/build` command automatically enforces these gates before marking any task as complete.

### Command Usage Example

```bash
# 1. Start from a GitHub issue
/plan issue=123

# 2. Build tasks in sequence from local files
/build issue=123          # Auto-detects next pending task
/build issue=123 task=2   # Or specify task explicitly

# 3. Sync progress to GitHub periodically
/sync issue=123

# 4. Verify the complete feature
/verify issue=123

# 5. Extract learnings and prepare PR
/reflect issue=123
```

### Local File Structure

After running `/plan issue=123`, you'll have:

```
tasks/issue-123/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.md       # Requirements, plan, and progress tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ session.md     # Real-time implementation notes and learnings
â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/         # Individual task files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01-setup.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 02-models.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 03-ui.md
â”œâ”€â”€ learnings.md   # Accumulated insights (created by /reflect)
â””â”€â”€ pr-description.md  # PR template (created by /reflect)
```

### Hybrid Workflow Benefits

The workflow combines local files with GitHub integration:

1. **Local Benefits**:
   - Rich context preserved in session notes
   - Fast access without API calls
   - Detailed journey documentation
   - Natural file-based workflows

2. **GitHub Benefits**:
   - Public progress visibility
   - Issue tracking integration
   - Team collaboration
   - Standard PR process

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Detailed progress in local session.md
   - Summary updates to GitHub via `/sync`
   - Course corrections marked with ðŸ”„ emoji
   - Continuous learning capture

### Workflow Philosophy

This workflow simulates a team of specialists:
- Each command activates a different cognitive mode
- Tasks are broken into manageable, focused pieces
- Session notes capture the implementation journey
- Learning accumulates throughout, not just at the end
- Hybrid approach balances documentation with visibility

For detailed workflow documentation, use the `/workflow` command.

## Knowledge Capture

Knowledge is captured continuously throughout development via GitHub:

1. **Feature Log**: A pinned comment on parent issues tracks all phases
2. **Progress Updates**: Real-time documentation in sub-issue comments
3. **Course Corrections**: Marked with ðŸ”„ emoji for easy identification
4. **Learnings**: Extracted during reflection and stored in LEARNINGS.md

For exploratory work outside the standard workflow:
- Create `notes/session-YYYYMMDD-topic.md` for documentation
- Capture decisions, experiments, and insights
- Link to relevant issues when applicable

## Custom Commands

When encountering commands with a leading slash (like `/command`):

- Check `.claude/commands/` directory for command definitions
- Commands follow the standard format: `/command param1="value1" param2="value2"`
- If you don't recognize a command, ask for clarification
- Available commands are documented in this section

## Migration Guidelines

- Never edit a migration file, only generate new migrations
- Because this is an Ash project, generate migrations using: `mix ash.codegen <name_of_change_to_resource>`

## Puppeteer Login Instructions (IMPORTANT - USE THIS!)

When testing with Puppeteer, use this exact process for magic link authentication:

```javascript
// 1. Navigate to home and click sign in
await navigate("http://localhost:4000")
await click('a[href="/sign-in"]')

// 2. Enter email from seeds.exs
await fill('input[name="user[email]"]', 'alice@example.com')
// Other options: bob@example.com (verified), admin@example.com (admin)

// 3. Request magic link
await click('button[type="submit"]')

// 4. Go to dev mailbox
await navigate("http://localhost:4000/dev/mailbox")

// 5. Click on the email row (NOT the mailto link!)
// The first email in the list should be for the user you just requested
await navigate("http://localhost:4000/dev/mailbox/[first-email-id]")

// 6. The email body will show with the magic link visible
// Either click the HTML body link or copy the magic link URL
// The magic link format: http://localhost:4000/auth/user/magic_link/?token=...

// 7. Navigate to the magic link URL
await navigate("[copied magic link URL]")

// You are now logged in!
```

**Important Notes:**
- Magic link tokens expire quickly (within minutes)
- If you get "Incorrect email or password", request a fresh magic link
- The dev mailbox is only available in development environment
- Always use emails from seeds.exs for consistent testing
