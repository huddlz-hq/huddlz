This is a web application written using the Phoenix web framework.

### Commit Messages

- Follow conventional commits format: `type(scope): concise description`
- Do not include AI attribution lines or AI-generated signatures
- "Co-Authored-By" is reserved for human collaborators only
- Keep first line under 70 characters, no period at the end
- Use imperative, present tense: "add" not "added" or "adds"
- Include a descriptive body with bullet points for specific changes when appropriate
- See `docs/commit-style.md` for complete guidelines

### Naming Conventions

**IMPORTANT: ALWAYS follow these naming conventions precisely**

- A singular event is called a "huddl" (lowercase) - **NEVER** use "event" or any other term
- Multiple events are called "huddlz" (lowercase) - **NEVER** use "events", "huddles", or any other term
- The platform/application name is "huddlz" (lowercase) in all branding, UI copy, and documentation
- In Elixir code, we follow standard conventions:
  - Module names are capitalized (e.g., `Huddlz.Huddls.Huddl`)
  - Variables and function names use snake_case
- When referring to events in comments and documentation, always use lowercase "huddl" and "huddlz"
- This terminology is core to our brand identity and must be maintained consistently

## Project guidelines

- Use `mix precommit` alias when you are done with all changes and fix any pending issues
- Use the already included and available `:req` (`Req`) library for HTTP requests, **avoid** `:httpoison`, `:tesla`, and `:httpc`. Req is included by default and is the preferred HTTP client for Phoenix apps

### Phoenix v1.8 guidelines

- **Always** begin your LiveView templates with `<Layouts.app flash={@flash} ...>` which wraps all inner content
- The `MyAppWeb.Layouts` module is aliased in the `my_app_web.ex` file, so you can use it without needing to alias it again
- Anytime you run into errors with no `current_scope` assign:
  - You failed to follow the Authenticated Routes guidelines, or you failed to pass `current_scope` to `<Layouts.app>`
  - **Always** fix the `current_scope` error by moving your routes to the proper `live_session` and ensure you pass `current_scope` as needed
- Phoenix v1.8 moved the `<.flash_group>` component to the `Layouts` module. You are **forbidden** from calling `<.flash_group>` outside of the `layouts.ex` module
- Out of the box, `core_components.ex` imports an `<.icon name="hero-x-mark" class="w-5 h-5"/>` component for for hero icons. **Always** use the `<.icon>` component for icons, **never** use `Heroicons` modules or similar
- **Always** use the imported `<.input>` component for form inputs from `core_components.ex` when available. `<.input>` is imported and using it will will save steps and prevent errors
- If you override the default input classes (`<.input class="myclass px-2 py-1 rounded-lg">)`) class with your own values, no default classes are inherited, so your
custom classes must fully style the input

### Form Validation Guidelines

- **Prefer Ash validation over HTML5 validation** for consistent error display across all validation scenarios
- **Avoid using HTML5 `required` attributes** on form inputs - instead rely on Ash's validation rules (e.g., `allow_nil? false`, `constraints: [min_length: 1]`)
- This ensures error messages are displayed consistently whether the field is blank, too short, invalid format, etc.
- AshPhoenix forms automatically display validation errors from the resource, providing a unified user experience

### JS and CSS guidelines

- **Use Tailwind CSS classes and custom CSS rules** to create polished, responsive, and visually stunning interfaces.
- Tailwindcss v4 **no longer needs a tailwind.config.js** and uses a new import syntax in `app.css`:

      @import "tailwindcss" source(none);
      @source "../css";
      @source "../js";
      @source "../../lib/my_app_web";

- **Always use and maintain this import syntax** in the app.css file for projects generated with `phx.new`
- **Never** use `@apply` when writing raw css
- **Always** manually write your own tailwind-based components instead of using daisyUI for a unique, world-class design
- Out of the box **only the app.js and app.css bundles are supported**
  - You cannot reference an external vendor'd script `src` or link `href` in the layouts
  - You must import the vendor deps into app.js and app.css to use them
  - **Never write inline <script>custom js</script> tags within templates**

### UI/UX & design guidelines

- **Produce world-class UI designs** with a focus on usability, aesthetics, and modern design principles
- Implement **subtle micro-interactions** (e.g., button hover effects, and smooth transitions)
- Ensure **clean typography, spacing, and layout balance** for a refined, premium look
- Focus on **delightful details** like hover effects, loading states, and smooth page transitions
