# Workflow Analysis and Recommendations
Date: 2025-05-24

## Goals
- Analyze discrepancies between documentation and actual workflows
- Identify unnecessary complexity in current commands
- Design GitHub Issues-based workflow integration
- Apply Claude Code best practices
- Propose simplified, more effective workflow

## Key Findings

### 1. Documentation Discrepancies

#### Missing Commands
- `/resume` command referenced in `development_lifecycle.md` but doesn't exist
- `/quickfix` command referenced in `development_lifecycle.md` but doesn't exist
- No command list in CLAUDE.md despite having custom commands

#### Session Documentation Confusion
- CLAUDE.md mentions "Automatically Create Session Notes" but there's no automation
- Commands don't create session notes as implied in documentation
- Inconsistent guidance on when/how to document work

#### Workflow Misalignment
- Complex 6-phase `/define` command poorly integrated with actual development
- Task decomposition creates excessive file management overhead
- User verification steps not clearly documented

### 2. Unnecessary Complexity

#### Overly Complex Commands
- `/define`: 6 phases for requirements gathering seems excessive
- `/plan`: Creates nested directory structures that add management overhead
- `/build`, `/verify`, `/reflect`: Could be simplified or combined

#### File Management Burden
- Multiple task files in timestamped directories
- Redundant documentation across index.md and task files
- Manual status tracking in multiple places

### 3. Missing GitHub Integration
- No connection to standard issue tracking
- No automated PR creation or linking
- Manual commit message creation without issue references

## Recommendations

### 1. Simplified Command Set

#### Keep These Commands (Modified)
- `/plan` - Simplified planning linked to GitHub issues
- `/review` - Combined verification and quality checks

#### Remove These Commands
- `/define` - Use GitHub issues for requirements
- `/build` - Standard development doesn't need a command
- `/verify` - Fold into `/review`
- `/reflect` - Integrate into PR process

#### Add These Commands
- `/work issue=123` - Start work on a GitHub issue
- `/complete` - Finish work and create PR

### 2. GitHub Issues-Based Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    issue[GitHub Issue Created] --> work[/work issue=123]
    work --> branch[Create Feature Branch]
    branch --> implement[Implementation]
    implement --> review[/review]
    review --> complete[/complete]
    complete --> pr[Create PR]
    pr --> merge[Merge & Close Issue]
```

Benefits:
- Single source of truth (GitHub)
- Standard tooling and visibility
- Automatic issue/PR linking
- Less file management

### 3. Improved Documentation Structure

#### Update CLAUDE.md
```markdown
## Available Commands

### Working with Issues
- `/work issue=123` - Start work on a GitHub issue
- `/plan issue=123` - Create implementation plan for an issue
- `/review` - Run tests and quality checks
- `/complete` - Create PR and finish work

### Workflow
1. Create or pick a GitHub issue
2. Use `/work issue=123` to start
3. Implement solution (no command needed)
4. Use `/review` to check quality
5. Use `/complete` to create PR
```

#### Automatic Session Notes
- Create session notes automatically when using `/work`
- Update throughout implementation
- Include in PR description

### 4. Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Document Current State
- Update CLAUDE.md with existing commands
- Fix discrepancies in documentation
- Add clear workflow section

#### Phase 2: Create GitHub Integration Commands
- Implement `/work` command
- Implement `/complete` command
- Simplify `/plan` to work with issues
- Convert `/verify` to `/review`

#### Phase 3: Deprecate Complex Commands
- Mark old commands as deprecated
- Provide migration guide
- Remove after transition period

## Claude Code Best Practices Application

### 1. Explore-First Approach
- `/work` command starts with exploration phase
- Encourages reading before coding
- Documents understanding in session notes

### 2. Explicit Planning
- Simplified `/plan` creates focused plans
- Links directly to issue requirements
- Avoids over-engineering

### 3. Iterative Development
- Natural commit-as-you-go workflow
- Regular `/review` checks
- Quick feedback loops

### 4. Clear Documentation
- CLAUDE.md as single source of truth
- Commands match actual workflow
- Less file proliferation

## Next Steps

1. Get user feedback on proposed changes
2. Update CLAUDE.md with current commands
3. Create prototype of new GitHub-integrated commands
4. Test simplified workflow on real feature
5. Gradually migrate from old to new approach

## Session Summary

Analyzed the current workflow documentation and commands, finding significant discrepancies and unnecessary complexity. The current system creates too many files, doesn't integrate with standard tools, and doesn't follow Claude Code best practices well.

Proposed a simplified, GitHub Issues-based workflow that:
- Reduces commands from 6 to 4
- Integrates with standard development tools
- Follows Claude Code best practices
- Maintains knowledge capture benefits
- Reduces file management overhead

The new workflow would be more intuitive, require less documentation, and align better with standard software development practices.
