## Code Examples

### Updated User Resource with Roles
```elixir
# In lib/huddlz/accounts/user.ex
attributes do
  uuid_primary_key :id

  attribute :email, :ci_string do
    allow_nil? false
    public? true
  end

  attribute :display_name, :string do
    allow_nil? true
    public? true
    description "User's display name shown in the UI"
  end

  attribute :role, :string do
    allow_nil? false
    default "regular"
    constraints one_of: ["regular", "verified", "admin"]
    description "User's role for permissions"
  end
end

# Add role update action
actions do
  # Existing actions...

  update :update_role do
    description "Update a user's role"
    argument :role, :string do
      allow_nil? false
      constraints one_of: ["regular", "verified", "admin"]
    end

    change fn changeset, _context ->
      Ash.Changeset.change_attribute(changeset, :role, changeset.arguments.role)
    end
  end
end
```

### Admin LiveView
```elixir
defmodule HuddlzWeb.AdminLive do
  use HuddlzWeb, :live_view

  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    # Verify admin access
    if socket.assigns.current_user && socket.assigns.current_user.role == "admin" do
      {:ok, assign(socket,
        page_title: "Admin Panel",
        search_results: [],
        search_term: "",
        error_message: nil
      )}
    else
      {:ok,
        socket
        |> put_flash(:error, "You don't have permission to access this page")
        |> redirect(to: ~p"/")}
    end
  end

  def handle_event("search", %{"search" => %{"term" => term}}, socket) do
    # Implement user search
    case search_users(term) do
      {:ok, users} ->
        {:noreply, assign(socket, search_results: users, search_term: term, error_message: nil)}
      {:error, message} ->
        {:noreply, assign(socket, error_message: message)}
    end
  end

  def handle_event("update_role", %{"id" => id, "role" => role}, socket) do
    # Implement role update
    case update_user_role(id, role) do
      {:ok, _} ->
        # Re-search to refresh the list
        {:ok, users} = search_users(socket.assigns.search_term)
        {:noreply,
          socket
          |> put_flash(:info, "User role updated successfully")
          |> assign(search_results: users)}

      {:error, message} ->
        {:noreply,
          socket
          |> put_flash(:error, "Failed to update role: #{message}")}
    end
  end

  # Helper functions for searching users and updating roles
  defp search_users(term) do
    Huddlz.Accounts.User
    |> Ash.Query.filter(like(email, ^"%#{term}%"))
    |> Ash.read()
  end

  defp update_user_role(id, role) do
    Huddlz.Accounts.User
    |> Ash.get!(id)
    |> Ash.Changeset.for_update(:update_role, %{role: role})
    |> Ash.update()
  end
end
```

### Router Update
```elixir
# In lib/huddlz_web/router.ex
scope "/", HuddlzWeb do
  pipe_through [:browser, :require_authenticated_user]

  # Existing authenticated routes...

  # Admin routes - will be further restricted in the LiveView
  live "/admin", AdminLive, :index
end
```

## Definition of Done
- User resource has role field with proper constraints
- Admin panel LiveView is created with proper authorization
- Users can be searched by email
- Admin users can change roles of other users
- Non-admin users cannot access the admin panel
- All tests pass

## Quality Assurance

### AI Verification (Throughout Implementation)
- Verify proper authorization checks in LiveView and router
- Test user search functionality
- Ensure role updates work correctly
- Check navigation links for admin-only visibility

### Human Verification (Required Before Next Task)
- After completing the admin panel, ask the user:
  "I've implemented the admin panel for user role management. Could you please verify the implementation by:
   1. Running the application (`mix phx.server`)
   2. Logging in as an admin user
   3. Accessing the admin panel and testing role updates
   If everything looks good, I'll proceed to the next task."
