## Code Examples

### Router Update
```elixir
# In lib/huddlz_web/router.ex
scope "/", HuddlzWeb do
  pipe_through [:browser, :require_authenticated_user]

  # Existing authenticated routes...

  live "/groups", GroupLive.Index, :index
  live "/groups/new", GroupLive.New, :new
  live "/groups/:id", GroupLive.Show, :show
end
```

### Group LiveView Index
```elixir
defmodule HuddlzWeb.GroupLive.Index do
  use HuddlzWeb, :live_view

  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    {:ok,
      socket
      |> assign(:groups, list_groups())
      |> assign(:can_create_group, can_create_group?(socket.assigns.current_user))
    }
  end

  defp list_groups do
    # If public groups, anyone can see them
    Huddlz.Communities.Group
    |> Ash.Query.filter(is_public == true)
    |> Ash.read!()
  end

  defp can_create_group?(user) do
    user && user.role in ["admin", "verified"]
  end
end
```

### Group LiveView New
```elixir
defmodule HuddlzWeb.GroupLive.New do
  use HuddlzWeb, :live_view

  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    # Check if user can create groups
    if socket.assigns.current_user &&
       socket.assigns.current_user.role in ["admin", "verified"] do

      changeset = Huddlz.Communities.Group
        |> Ash.Changeset.for_create(:create, %{})

      {:ok,
        socket
        |> assign(:changeset, changeset)
      }
    else
      {:ok,
        socket
        |> put_flash(:error, "You need to be a verified user to create groups")
        |> redirect(to: ~p"/groups")}
    end
  end

  def handle_event("save", %{"group" => group_params}, socket) do
    # Add owner from current user
    params = Map.put(group_params, "owner_id", socket.assigns.current_user.id)

    case create_group(params) do
      {:ok, group} ->
        {:noreply,
          socket
          |> put_flash(:info, "Group created successfully")
          |> redirect(to: ~p"/groups/#{group.id}")}

      {:error, changeset} ->
        {:noreply, assign(socket, :changeset, changeset)}
    end
  end

  defp create_group(params) do
    Huddlz.Communities.Group
    |> Ash.Changeset.for_create(:create_group, params)
    |> Ash.create()
  end
end
```

### Group Creation Template
```heex
<.header>
  Create a New Group
  <:subtitle>Create a group to organize huddlz and connect with others</:subtitle>
</.header>

<.simple_form :let={f} for={@changeset} phx-submit="save">
  <.input field={f[:name]} label="Group Name" required />
  <.input field={f[:description]} label="Description" type="textarea" />
  <.input field={f[:location]} label="Location" />
  <.input field={f[:image_url]} label="Image URL" />

  <div class="space-y-2">
    <.label>Privacy</.label>
    <div class="flex items-center gap-4">
      <.input field={f[:is_public]} label="Public group (anyone can join)" type="checkbox" checked={true} />
    </div>
    <.hint>Public groups are visible to everyone and anyone can join. Private groups require invitations.</.hint>
  </div>

  <:actions>
    <.button type="submit" phx-disable-with="Creating...">Create Group</.button>
  </:actions>
</.simple_form>
```

## Definition of Done
- Group creation form is implemented
- Only admins and verified users can create groups
- Group validation works correctly
- Public/private setting works
- Navigation between groups index and creation page works
- Successful creation redirects to the group page

## Quality Assurance

### AI Verification (Throughout Implementation)
- Verify form validation works correctly
- Check authorization to ensure only admins and verified users can create groups
- Test public/private setting is saved correctly
- Ensure owner relationship is established

### Human Verification (Required Before Next Task)
- After completing group creation, ask the user:
  "I've implemented the group creation functionality. Could you please verify the implementation by:
   1. Running the application (`mix phx.server`)
   2. Logging in as an admin or verified user
   3. Creating a new group and verifying it appears in the listing
   If everything looks good, I'll proceed to the next task."
