### Human Verification (Required Before Next Task)
- After completing the entire implementation checklist, ask the user:
  "I've completed the admin panel implementation. Could you please verify the implementation by:
   1. Running the application (`mix phx.server`)
   2. Testing the admin panel functionality
   If everything looks good, I'll proceed to the next task (Task 2)."
