# Task: Create Group Resource

## Context
- Part of feature: Group Management
- Sequence: Task 3 of 8
- Purpose: Define the core Group resource with all necessary attributes and relationships

## Task Boundaries
- In scope:
  - Group schema definition with all required attributes
  - Relationships setup (owner, members)
  - Access control policies
  - Basic CRUD actions
- Out of scope:
  - Migration generation (separate task)
  - UI implementation
  - Integration with huddlz

## Current Status
- Progress: 100%
- Blockers: None
- Current activity: Completed

## Requirements Analysis
- Create a Group resource using Ash Framework in the Communities domain
- Include fields: name, description, location, image_url, is_public
- Establish relationships:
  - belongs_to :owner (User) - The user who created the group
  - many_to_many :members (User) - Users who are members of the group
- Set up proper identities and constraints
- Define appropriate access policies
- Implement necessary CRUD actions

## Implementation Plan
- Create the Group resource module in lib/huddlz/communities/group.ex
- Define attributes and relationships
- Implement basic actions (create, read, update, destroy)
- Add specialized actions for managing group membership
- Set up access policies to restrict group creation to admins and verified users

## Implementation Checklist
1. Create the Group resource module file
2. Define basic attributes (name, description, location, image_url, is_public)
3. Add timestamp attributes (created_at, updated_at)
4. Set up owner relationship (belongs_to User)
5. Set up members relationship (many_to_many User)
6. Create the join resource for group memberships (GroupMember)
7. Implement standard CRUD actions
8. Add specialized actions for membership management
9. Set up appropriate access policies
10. Define identities for uniqueness constraints

- lib/huddlz/communities/group.ex (to be created)
- lib/huddlz/communities/group_member.ex (to be created for many-to-many)
- lib/huddlz/communities.ex (to update with new resources)

## Code Examples

### Group Resource
```elixir
defmodule Huddlz.Communities.Group do
  use Ash.Resource,
    otp_app: :huddlz,
    domain: Huddlz.Communities,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer

  postgres do
    table "groups"
    repo Huddlz.Repo
  end

  attributes do
    uuid_primary_key :id

    attribute :name, :string do
      allow_nil? false
      constraints min_length: 3, max_length: 100
    end

    attribute :description, :string do
      allow_nil? true
    end

    attribute :location, :string do
      allow_nil? true
    end

    attribute :image_url, :string do
      allow_nil? true
    end

    attribute :is_public, :boolean do
      allow_nil? false
      default true
    end

    create_timestamp :created_at
    update_timestamp :updated_at
  end

  relationships do
    belongs_to :owner, Huddlz.Accounts.User do
      attribute_type :uuid
      allow_nil? false
      primary_key? false
    end

    many_to_many :members, Huddlz.Accounts.User do
      through Huddlz.Communities.GroupMember
      source_attribute_on_join_resource :group_id
      destination_attribute_on_join_resource :user_id
    end
  end

  actions do
    defaults [:create, :read, :update, :destroy]

    create :create_group do
      description "Create a new group"
      accept [:name, :description, :location, :image_url, :is_public]

      argument :owner_id, :uuid do
        allow_nil? false
      end

      change manage_relationship(:owner_id, :owner, type: :append)
    end
  end

  identities do
    identity :unique_name, [:name]
  end
end
```

### Group Member Join Resource
```elixir
defmodule Huddlz.Communities.GroupMember do
  use Ash.Resource,
    otp_app: :huddlz,
    domain: Huddlz.Communities,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer

  postgres do
    table "group_members"
    repo Huddlz.Repo
  end

  actions do
    defaults [:create, :read, :destroy]
  end

  attributes do
    uuid_primary_key :id

    attribute :role, :string do
      allow_nil? false
      default "member"
      constraints one_of: ["member", "admin"]
    end

    create_timestamp :created_at
  end

  relationships do
    belongs_to :group, Huddlz.Communities.Group do
      attribute_type :uuid
      allow_nil? false
      primary_key? false
    end

    belongs_to :user, Huddlz.Accounts.User do
      attribute_type :uuid
      allow_nil? false
      primary_key? false
    end
  end

  identities do
    identity :unique_group_user, [:group_id, :user_id]
  end
end
```
