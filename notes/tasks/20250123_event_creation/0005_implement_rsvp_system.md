## Definition of Done
- Users can RSVP to accessible events
- RSVP count is tracked and displayed
- Users see their RSVP status on events
- Virtual links appear after RSVP
- No duplicate RSVPs allowed
- Authorization is properly enforced

## Quality Assurance

### AI Verification (Throughout Implementation)
- Run appropriate tests after each checklist item
- Run `mix format` before committing changes
- Verify compilation with `mix compile` regularly

### Human Verification (Required Before Next Task)
- After completing the entire implementation checklist, ask the user:
  "I've completed task 5 (Implement RSVP System). Could you please verify the implementation by:
   1. Running the application (`mix phx.server`)
   2. RSVPing to a public event
   3. Checking the RSVP count updates
   4. Verifying virtual link appears after RSVP
   If everything looks good, I'll proceed to the next task (Task 6: Add Event Search)."
