## Definition of Done
- Search input filters results by title/description
- Event type filter works correctly
- Date range filters show appropriate events
- Results update live without page reload
- All filters can be combined
- Performance is acceptable
- Access control is maintained

## Quality Assurance

### AI Verification (Throughout Implementation)
- Run appropriate tests after each checklist item
- Run `mix format` before committing changes
- Verify compilation with `mix compile` regularly

### Human Verification (Required Before Next Task)
- After completing the entire implementation checklist, ask the user:
  "I've completed task 6 (Add Event Search) - the final task. Could you please verify the implementation by:
   1. Running the application (`mix phx.server`)
   2. Testing search functionality
   3. Trying different filter combinations
   4. Verifying only public events appear

   This completes the Event Creation feature! Would you like me to create a summary of what was implemented?"

## Progress Tracking
- Update after completing each checklist item
- Mark items as completed with timestamps
- Document any issues encountered and how they were resolved

## Commit Instructions
- Make atomic commits after completing logical units of work
- Before finishing the task, ensure all changes are committed
