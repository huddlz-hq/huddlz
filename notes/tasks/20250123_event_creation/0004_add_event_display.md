# Task: Add Event Display

## Context
- Part of feature: Event Creation (Huddlz)
- Sequence: Task 4 of 6
- Purpose: Display huddlz on group pages and create a main huddlz listing page

## Task Boundaries
- In scope:
  - Show upcoming huddlz on group pages
  - Create main huddlz search/listing page
  - Display event details (without virtual link)
  - Show event status (upcoming/ongoing/past)
  - Basic event cards/list items
- Out of scope:
  - RSVP functionality
  - Calendar views
  - Complex filtering (just basic for MVP)
  - Event detail pages

## Current Status
- Progress: 100%
- Blockers: None
- Current activity: Completed

## Requirements Analysis
- Group pages should list their upcoming huddlz
- Main page should search/list all public huddlz
- Events should show: title, description, date/time, location, type, status
- Virtual links remain hidden until RSVP
- Clear visual distinction between event types
- Chronological ordering (soonest first)

## Implementation Plan
- Add huddlz section to group LiveView
- Create new main huddlz listing LiveView
- Build reusable event display component
- Implement proper queries with access control
- Add basic search/filter functionality

## Quality Assurance

### AI Verification (Throughout Implementation)
- Run appropriate tests after each checklist item
- Run `mix format` before committing changes
- Verify compilation with `mix compile` regularly

### Human Verification (Required Before Next Task)
- After completing the entire implementation checklist, ask the user:
  "I've completed task 4 (Add Event Display). Could you please verify the implementation by:
   1. Running the application (`mix phx.server`)
   2. Checking huddlz appear on group pages
   3. Testing the main huddlz search page
   4. Verifying private events don't show publicly
   If everything looks good, I'll proceed to the next task (Task 5: Implement RSVP System)."
