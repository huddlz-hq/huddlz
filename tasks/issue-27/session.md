# Session Notes - Issue #27: Password Authentication

## Planning Phase

### Requirements Gathering Q&A

1. **Authentication Strategy Coexistence**: Allow both magic links and passwords on same account
2. **Registration Flow**: Option C - Give users choice with DaisyUI radio buttons
3. **Password Requirements**: Use Ash Authentication defaults
4. **Password Reset**: Use Ash Authentication defaults
5. **Existing Users**: No forced migration (Option A)
6. **Sign-In UI**: Two forms with DaisyUI divider (Option C)
7. **Security**: Trust Ash Authentication defaults
8. **Profile Management**: Simple password change form for add/update
9. **Error Handling**: Use Ash Authentication defaults

### Key Decisions

- Leverage Ash Authentication's built-in capabilities throughout
- No custom password requirements or security features initially
- Keep UI simple with two-form approach
- Existing users remain unaffected
- Minimal customization to speed up implementation

### Technical Approach

Will use Ash Authentication's password strategy alongside existing magic link strategy. The framework should handle most of the heavy lifting.

## Implementation Phase

### Important Note
User has already run Ash generators for password authentication. Our focus is on:
1. Verifying what's been generated
2. Ensuring comprehensive tests exist

### Task 1: Verify Password Strategy Implementation

#### Verification Started
- ✅ Password strategy added to authentication block
- ✅ hashed_password attribute exists (line 367-369)
- ✅ Password actions configured:
  - `register_with_password` (line 231-267)
  - `sign_in_with_password` (line 180-202)
  - `sign_in_with_token` (line 204-229)
  - `change_password` (line 157-178)
  - `request_password_reset_token` (line 269-278)
  - `reset_password_with_token` (line 280-310)
- ✅ Password reset sender exists at `lib/huddlz/accounts/user/senders/send_password_reset_email.ex`
- ✅ Confirmation sender exists for new users
- ✅ Authentication add-ons configured (log_out_everywhere on password change)

#### Important Notes
- 🔄 Phoenix server is kept running to serve Tidewave - no need to start it when Tidewave tools are available
- Need to update CLAUDE.md with this information

#### Visual Verification Results
- ✅ Sign-in page: Shows both password and magic link forms with "or" separator
- ✅ Registration page: Shows both methods (password with confirmation + magic link)
- ✅ Password reset page: Shows both reset options
- ❌ Profile page: No password management section yet (needs implementation)

#### Summary for Task 1
Ash generators have successfully implemented:
- All password-related actions in User resource
- Database migration for hashed_password field
- Authentication UI with dual forms on sign-in, register, and reset pages
- Password reset email sender

Still needed:
- Password management in profile page
- Comprehensive tests for all password functionality

### Task 2: Database Migration Verification

#### Verification Results
- ✅ Migration exists: `20250602131818_add_password_authentication_and_add_password_auth.exs`
- ✅ Migration has been run successfully
- ✅ Database fields verified through tests:
  - hashed_password field exists
  - confirmed_at field exists
- ✅ All password-related actions are accessible:
  - register_with_password
  - sign_in_with_password
  - change_password
  - request_password_reset_token
  - reset_password_with_token

#### Test Issues Found
- 🔄 Existing Cucumber tests are failing due to multiple email fields on sign-in page
- Need to update step definitions to handle multiple forms

### Task 3: Sign-In Page UI

#### Status: Using Ash Defaults
- ✅ Sign-in page shows both password and magic link forms
- ✅ Forms are separated with "or" text
- ✅ Both authentication methods are functional
- 📝 Note: Keeping default UI for now, custom DaisyUI styling will be addressed in a future issue

### Task 4: Registration Page

#### Status: Using Ash Defaults
- ✅ Registration page already shows both methods
- ✅ Password registration includes email, password, and password confirmation fields
- ✅ Magic link registration shows email-only form
- ✅ Both registration methods are functional
- 📝 Note: Radio button selection will be addressed in future UI issue

### Task 5: Password Management in Profile

#### Implementation Complete
- ✅ Added password management section to profile page
- ✅ Created `set_password` action for users without passwords
- ✅ Added policies for both `change_password` and `set_password` actions
- ✅ Profile page dynamically shows "Set Password" or "Change Password" based on user state
- ✅ Form includes current password field only when changing existing password
- ✅ Account Information section moved to top as requested
- ✅ Password form shows/hides with button click for cleaner UI

#### Implementation Details
- Used conditional logic to select appropriate action based on `hashed_password` presence
- Password form validation and error handling integrated with AshPhoenix.Form
- Success messages differentiate between setting and updating password

### Task 6: Routes and Navigation

#### Verification Results
- ✅ All password-related routes are configured:
  - `/register` - Registration page
  - `/reset` - Password reset request page
  - `/password-reset/:token` - Password reset with token
  - `/auth/user/password/*` - API endpoints for password operations
- ✅ Navigation links present:
  - "Sign Up" and "Sign In" in main navigation
  - "Forgot your password?" on sign-in page
  - "Need an account?" on sign-in page
  - "Already have an account?" on registration page
- ✅ All routes are accessible and functional

#### Summary
All routes and navigation are properly configured by Ash Authentication Phoenix. No additional work needed.

### Task 7: Testing and Edge Cases

#### Test Implementation
- ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests in `test/huddlz/accounts/password_functionality_test.exs`
  - Tests for registration with password
  - Tests for sign in with password
  - Tests for setting password (users without password)
  - Tests for changing password (users with password)
  - Tests for password reset flow
- ✅ Created Cucumber feature tests in `test/features/password_authentication.feature`
  - UI flow tests for registration
  - UI flow tests for sign in
  - UI flow tests for password management in profile
  - UI flow tests for password reset
- ✅ Created step definitions in `test/features/step_definitions/password_authentication_steps.exs`
- ✅ Fixed existing test issues:
  - Updated email field selectors to handle multiple forms on sign-in page
  - Fixed `sign_in_and_sign_out_steps.exs` to use specific field IDs
  - Fixed `complete_signup_flow_steps.exs` to use specific field IDs

#### Important Fixes
- 🔄 Existing tests were failing due to multiple email fields on the sign-in page
- Changed from generic "Email" label to specific field IDs:
  - Magic link: `user-magic-link-request-magic-link_email`
  - Password sign in: `user-password-sign-in-with-password_email`
  - Password register: `user-password-register-with-password_email`

#### Test Implementation Results
- ✅ Unit tests for password functionality are comprehensive
- ✅ Created password-specific test file with all edge cases covered
- ✅ Updated test generator to include `user_with_password` helper
- 🔄 Some Cucumber tests need refinement due to PhoenixTest limitations with multiple forms
- 📝 Note: PhoenixTest has challenges with multiple forms on same page - may need custom selectors

## Summary

### Completed Implementation
1. **Password Strategy**: Successfully added to User resource with all necessary actions
2. **Database Migration**: Created and applied for hashed_password and confirmed_at fields
3. **UI Integration**: Sign-in, registration, and reset pages all show dual authentication options
4. **Password Management**: Profile page allows users to set/change passwords
5. **Routes & Navigation**: All password-related routes configured and accessible
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests created, Cucumber tests partially implemented

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Users can register with either password or magic link
- ✅ Existing users can add passwords to their accounts
- ✅ Password reset flow implemented
- ✅ Both authentication methods work on same account
- ✅ No disruption to existing magic link users
- ✅ All Ash Authentication defaults leveraged successfully

### Known Issues
- 🔄 PhoenixTest has difficulties with multiple forms containing same field labels
- 📝 Some Cucumber step definitions may need refinement for form selection
- 📝 May need to add custom test helpers for multi-form pages

### Next Steps
- Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- Consider adding UI improvements in future issue (as mentioned)
- Monitor for any edge cases in production
