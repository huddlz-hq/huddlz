# Learnings - Issue 41: Custom Authentication Pages

*This file will be populated during the implementation phase*

## Planning Phase Insights

### 1. AshAuthentication.Phoenix Trade-offs

The default authentication views from AshAuthentication.Phoenix provide:
- Quick setup with minimal code
- Security best practices out of the box
- Consistent patterns with Ash Framework

However, they limit:
- UI/UX customization
- Separation of authentication strategies
- Branding opportunities

### 2. Architecture Decisions

Custom authentication pages require:
- Direct use of Ash authentication actions
- Manual session and token handling
- Careful attention to security details
- More test coverage

### 3. Implementation Strategy

Breaking down into 5 focused tasks:
1. Sign-in (both strategies)
2. Registration (password only)
3. Password reset (two-page flow)
4. Set password (for magic link users)
5. Navigation and polish

This allows incremental development and testing.

## To Be Continued...

More learnings will be captured during the implementation phase.
