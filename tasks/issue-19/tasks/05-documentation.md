## Purpose
Document the new shared steps pattern and update any test-related documentation to help future developers understand and use the shared modules effectively.

## Scope

### Must Include

- Add usage examples for shared modules
- Document cucumber 0.2.0 upgrade benefits
- Clean up any temporary files or comments

### Explicitly Excludes

- [x] Document available shared steps in each module
- [x] Add examples of how to use shared steps
- [x] Update project README if it mentions testing (already had good testing info)
- [x] Add inline documentation to shared modules if needed
- [x] Remove any TODO comments added during refactoring (none found)
- [x] Final test run to ensure everything works
