## Purpose
Upgrade the cucumber dependency from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0 to access the new shared steps functionality.

## Scope

### Must Include
- Update mix.exs dependency version
- Run mix deps.get to fetch new version
- Ensure project compiles without errors
- Run existing tests to verify compatibility

### Explicitly Excludes
- Refactoring any test code (that's for later tasks)
- Adding new functionality
- Changing test structure

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Update cucumber version in mix.exs from ~> 0.1.0 to ~> 0.2.0
- [x] Run `mix deps.get` to fetch the new version
- [x] Run `mix compile` to ensure no compilation errors
- [x] Run `mix test test/features/` to verify all cucumber tests still pass
- [ ] Commit the dependency update

## Technical Details
- File to modify: `mix.exs` line 83
- Current version: `{:cucumber, "~> 0.1.0", only: [:dev, :test]}`
- Target version: `{:cucumber, "~> 0.2.0", only: [:dev, :test]}`
- Verify mix.lock is updated after deps.get

## Acceptance Criteria
- mix.exs shows cucumber ~> 0.2.0
- mix deps.get completes successfully
- mix compile shows no errors
- All existing cucumber tests pass
- mix.lock is updated with new version

## Dependencies
