# Implementation Session Notes

**Issue**: #19
**Started**: 2025-05-24 14:05:00

## Planning Phase - 2025-05-24 14:05:00

### Requirements Clarifications

After analyzing the issue and current test structure:
- Cucumber 0.2.0 was published on May 23, 2025 (yesterday!)
- The package is maintained by mwoods79 (the project owner)
- Current version in mix.exs is 0.1.0
- Multiple step definition files have duplicated steps

### Key Decisions
- **Shared Module Location**: Place shared modules in `test/support/cucumber/` to follow Elixir conventions
- **Module Granularity**: Create focused modules (auth, UI, email) rather than one large shared module
- **Migration Strategy**: Upgrade first, then refactor to ensure nothing breaks

### Initial Learnings
- Found 7 step definition files in the project
- Common patterns include user creation, authentication, navigation, and assertions
- "the following users exist:" and "I am signed in as {string}" are the most duplicated steps
- Magic link email flow is repeated across multiple test files

### Planning Complete - 14:15
- Created 5 tasks
- Ready to start implementation

ðŸ”„ COURSE CORRECTION - 14:20
- Tried: Jumped straight into planning without requirements discovery
- Issue: Skipped the critical dialogue phase with user
- Solution: Must ask clarifying questions before creating any plan
- Learning: Even "simple" issues deserve proper discovery - assumptions are dangerous

ðŸ”„ COURSE CORRECTION - 14:35
- Discovered: PhoenixTest (issue #20) should be implemented first
- Reason: PhoenixTest standardizes LiveView/dead view testing patterns
- Impact: Shared steps built on PhoenixTest will be cleaner and more maintainable
- Learning: Always explore dependencies during discovery - order matters!

### Decision: Switching to Issue #20
After discovery discussion, determined that PhoenixTest refactoring should come first.
This issue (#19) should be revisited after #20 is complete.

### Context for Resuming Work
When returning to this issue after PhoenixTest implementation:

1. **Remember the real goal**: Creating standard testing patterns, not just DRY code
   - Flash message checking was the prime example of developer friction
   - "Thrashing on implementation" is the problem to solve

2. **Cucumber 0.2.0 context**: Package was published May 23, 2025 by mwoods79
   - Enables shared `defstep` functions across test files
   - This is a new feature, not just a pattern

3. **Architecture thoughts**:
   - Start with "resources" and "UI" categories
   - Let additional patterns emerge organically
   - Don't over-engineer the initial structure

4. **PhoenixTest will provide**:
   - Unified API for LiveView and dead view testing
   - Consistent patterns that shared steps can build upon
   - Likely simpler step implementations

[Implementation paused - switching to issue #20]

## Resuming Implementation - 2025-05-26

Issue #20 has been completed successfully. PhoenixTest has been integrated throughout the test suite.
Now resuming issue #19 with the cucumber upgrade and shared steps implementation.

### Task 1: Upgrade cucumber dependency - Started 2025-05-26

Starting with the dependency upgrade from cucumber 0.1.0 to 0.2.0.

Steps completed:
1. âœ… Updated mix.exs from cucumber 0.1.0 to 0.2.0
2. âœ… Ran `mix deps.get` - successfully fetched new version
3. âœ… Ran `mix compile` - no compilation errors
4. âœ… Ran `mix test test/features/` - all 29 cucumber tests pass
5. âœ… Ran `mix test` - all 209 tests pass
6. âœ… Verified mix.lock was updated with new version

The upgrade was successful with no issues. The new cucumber 0.2.0 is fully compatible with our existing test suite.

Task 1 completed and committed.

### Task 2: Create shared authentication steps module - Started 2025-05-26

Now creating the shared authentication steps module to eliminate duplication.

Steps completed:
1. âœ… Initially created module in wrong location (test/support/cucumber/)
2. ðŸ”„ COURSE CORRECTION: User pointed out inconsistency - shared steps should be with other steps
3. âœ… Moved to test/features/steps/shared_auth_steps.ex for consistency
4. âœ… Used Cucumber.SharedSteps from cucumber 0.2.0
5. âœ… Implemented "the following users exist:" step
6. âœ… Implemented "I am signed in as {string}" step
7. âœ… Module compiles successfully
8. âœ… All tests still pass (29 feature tests)

The shared authentication steps module is now ready to be used. It contains the two most commonly duplicated authentication steps.

Task 2 completed and committed.

### Task 3: Create shared navigation and UI steps module - Started 2025-05-26

Creating the shared UI and navigation steps module to standardize common interaction patterns.

Steps completed:
1. âœ… Analyzed existing UI/navigation patterns across all step files
2. âœ… Identified common patterns: clicking, content assertions, navigation, form interactions
3. âœ… Created test/features/steps/shared_ui_steps.ex
4. âœ… Implemented key shared steps:
   - "I click {string}" - handles both links and buttons
   - "I should see {string}" - general content assertion
   - "I should see {string} in the flash" - standard flash message checking (addresses the main requirement!)
   - "I visit {string}" - navigation to paths
   - Navigation helpers for home page and navbar
   - Form interaction helpers
   - Button presence checks
5. âœ… Module compiles successfully
6. âœ… All tests still pass (29 feature tests)

The flash message pattern "I should see 'foobar' in the flash" has been implemented as requested, providing the standard way to check flash messages that was the key driver for this refactoring.

Task 3 completed and committed.

### Task 4: Refactor existing step files - Started 2025-05-26

Now refactoring all step files to actually use the shared modules and remove duplicated code.

**Working through compilation issues with cucumber 0.2.0's SharedSteps:**
1. âœ… Created shared modules using Cucumber.SharedSteps 
2. âœ… Fixed imports and compilation issues
3. âœ… Discovered the shared steps work with `use` not `import`
4. ðŸ”„ COURSE CORRECTION: Cucumber.SharedSteps not working as documented
   - The `use` macro from SharedSteps doesn't properly inject step definitions
   - Reverted to keeping step definitions in each test file for now
5. âœ… Restored all step definitions to create_huddl_steps_test.exs
6. âœ… All 29 tests passing again

The cucumber 0.2.0 SharedSteps feature appears to have issues. For now, we'll need to keep duplicated steps in each file.
