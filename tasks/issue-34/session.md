# Session Notes - Issue #34: User Profiles

## Planning Phase (2025-01-06)

### Requirements Discovery
Through careful questioning, we established:

1. **Privacy Philosophy**: 
   - Initially considered "Anonymous" as default name
   - Discussed various anonymous identifier schemes
   - Decided to keep current "ColorAnimal123" format but fix the bug

2. **Navigation Design**:
   - Profile icon far right (always visible, not in hamburger)
   - Admin Panel moves from navbar to dropdown
   - Groups link moves to left
   - Mobile: hamburger → brand → profile icon

3. **Theme Toggle Decision**:
   - Becomes a "logged-in user perk"
   - Removed from navbar, added to profile dropdown
   - Smart product decision to encourage sign-ups

4. **Profile Page Design**:
   - Route: `/profile` (not `/settings` - reserving `/account` for future payments)
   - Simple form approach (not over-engineered)
   - Display name validation: 1-30 characters
   - Flash message for feedback (maintaining consistency)

5. **Testing Approach**:
   - Dedicated regression test for the bug
   - Separate from implementation fixes

### Key Design Decisions
- Keep everything simple until there's a reason not to
- Consistency over personal preference (flash messages)
- Privacy-first approach maintained
- Mobile experience carefully considered

## Implementation Phase

### Task 1: Fix display name bug + regression test ✅

**Changes Made:**
1. Fixed `sign_in_with_magic_link` action in User resource:
   - Removed `:display_name` from `upsert_fields` (was `[:email, :display_name]`, now just `[:email]`)
   - Modified `before_action` to check `!changeset.data.id` to detect new users
   - Only generates random display name for new users without one

2. Added comprehensive regression tests:
   - Test for display name persistence across logins
   - Test for new user display name generation
   - Test for respecting explicit display names

**Key Insight:** The bug was caused by `upsert_fields` including `:display_name`, which meant every login would update the display name field. By removing it from upsert_fields and checking if the user is new in the before_action, we ensure display names only get set once.

**Quality Gates:** All tests pass (274 total), code formatted, credo strict passes.

### Refactoring: Extract display name generation to change module

**User Request:** Move the `before_action` logic into a proper change module following the pattern in `lib/huddlz/communities/group/changes/generate_slug.ex`

**Changes Made:**
1. Created `lib/huddlz/accounts/user/changes/set_default_display_name.ex`
   - Implements `use Ash.Resource.Change` 
   - Moved display name generation logic from User resource
   - Checks action type and new user status properly

2. Updated User resource:
   - Replaced `before_action` with `change Huddlz.Accounts.User.Changes.SetDefaultDisplayName`
   - Removed `generate_random_display_name` function
   - Applied to both `:create` and `:sign_in_with_magic_link` actions

3. Updated tests to match refactored code

**Result:** Cleaner architecture following established patterns, all tests still pass.

### Task 2: Add profile icon and dropdown structure ✅

**Changes Made:**
1. Added profile icon with generic person SVG (hero-user) in navbar far right
2. Implemented DaisyUI dropdown with proper classes and structure
3. Moved Groups link to left side (desktop) and hamburger menu (mobile)
4. Added responsive hamburger menu for mobile navigation
5. Theme toggle moved from navbar to dropdown for logged-in users (becomes a perk)

**Dropdown Contents:**
- "Signed in as" with display name
- Profile link (placeholder for now)
- Admin Panel (conditional for admins)
- Sign Out
- Theme toggle (at very bottom, properly sized with scale-75)

**Mobile Behavior:**
- Hamburger menu on left → Logo → Profile icon on right
- Dropdown works perfectly on mobile
- Groups link hidden on desktop navbar, shown in hamburger

**Quality Gates:** All tests pass (274 total), code formatted, credo strict passes.
