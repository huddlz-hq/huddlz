# Feature Specification: Date Time Selection for Huddl Creation

**Feature Branch**: `001-date-time-selection`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "date time selection when creating huddlz. instead of having datetime pickers, modify the huddl creation to have a single date picker, a singler time picker and a picker that selects the length of the huddl. for instance 29-09-2025 11:30am 2 hours. time selection should default to 15 minute increments but allow the user to manually enter the time."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: Should the date picker allow selection of past dates for huddl creation? ‚Üí A: Future dates only (today and beyond)
- Q: What should be the minimum duration allowed for a huddl? ‚Üí A: 15 minutes
- Q: What should be the maximum duration allowed for a huddl? ‚Üí A: 24 hours (full day)
- Q: Should the system prevent scheduling conflicts when creating huddlz that overlap with existing ones? ‚Üí A: Allow without any check
- Q: Which predefined duration options should be available in the duration picker? ‚Üí A: 30m, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 2.5h, 3h, 4h, 6h
- Q: Should the time picker support 24-hour format in addition to 12-hour AM/PM format? ‚Üí A: 12-hour AM/PM format only
- Q: How should the system handle timezone differences for participants viewing the huddl? ‚Üí A: Store in UTC, display in viewer's local timezone

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user creating a huddl, I want to select the date, start time, and duration separately so that I can more easily schedule events with standard time blocks (e.g., 2-hour meetings) without having to manually calculate end times.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is creating a new huddl, **When** they access the date/time fields, **Then** they see three separate selectors: date picker, time picker, and duration picker
2. **Given** a user clicks on the time picker, **When** the picker opens, **Then** time options appear in 15-minute increments by default
3. **Given** a user wants a non-standard start time, **When** they click on the time field, **Then** they can manually type in any valid time
4. **Given** a user selects date "2025-09-29", time "11:30 AM", and duration "2 hours", **When** they save the huddl, **Then** the huddl is created with start time "2025-09-29 11:30 AM" and end time "2025-09-29 1:30 PM"
5. **Given** a user is selecting a duration, **When** they view the duration options, **Then** they see predefined options: 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 2.5 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours

### Edge Cases
- When a manually entered time is invalid (e.g., "25:99"), the system displays an error message "Please enter a valid time in HH:MM AM/PM format"
- Daylight saving time transitions are handled automatically by the browser's timezone conversion
- When a duration extends into the next day, the end time displays with a "(next day)" indicator
- Time zone differences are handled by storing in UTC and displaying in each user's local timezone (see FR-013)
- Minimum duration is 15 minutes, maximum duration is 24 hours

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide three separate input fields for huddl scheduling: date, start time, and duration
- **FR-002**: Date picker MUST allow selection of future dates only (today and beyond)
- **FR-003**: Time picker MUST display time options in 15-minute increments (e.g., 11:00, 11:15, 11:30, 11:45)
- **FR-004**: Time picker MUST support 12-hour (AM/PM) format only
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to manually type a custom time that doesn't align with 15-minute increments
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate manually entered times and display error messages for invalid formats
- **FR-007**: Duration picker MUST offer predefined durations: 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 2.5 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours
- **FR-008**: System MUST calculate and display the end time based on selected start time and duration
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle time calculations correctly across day boundaries (e.g., 11 PM + 3 hours = 2 AM next day)
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow huddlz to be scheduled without checking for conflicts with existing huddlz
- **FR-011**: Duration MUST have a minimum of 15 minutes
- **FR-012**: Duration MUST have a maximum of 24 hours
- **FR-013**: System MUST store all datetime values in UTC and display them in each viewer's local timezone

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Huddl**: An event with a start datetime and end datetime calculated from date, time, and duration selections
- **Date Selection**: The calendar date when the huddl occurs
- **Time Selection**: The start time of the huddl, supporting both incremental selection and manual entry
- **Duration**: The length of the huddl, used to calculate the end time
