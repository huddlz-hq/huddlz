# Feature Specification: Signup Display Name

**Feature Branch**: `002-signup-display-name`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Signup display name. When a user signs up they should have a field to enter the display name. The display name input should suggest first and last name."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: Must display names be unique across all users, or can multiple users share the same display name? ‚Üí A: Display names can be shared by multiple users (non-unique)
- Q: What is the maximum character length allowed for display names? ‚Üí A: 70 characters
- Q: Should single-name display names (e.g., just "John") be allowed, or must users provide both first and last names? ‚Üí A: Allow single-name display names (any non-empty string is valid)
- Q: What characters are allowed in display names (letters, numbers, spaces, special characters, emojis)? ‚Üí A: All printable characters including emojis and special symbols
- Q: Can users edit their display name after signup? ‚Üí A: Yes, users can freely edit their display name anytime
- Q: Where should the display name be shown to other users? ‚Üí A: Everywhere a user is referenced throughout the platform

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A new user visits the signup page to create an account. During signup, they need to provide a display name that represents how they want to be identified within the platform. The system should guide them to provide their first and last name as the display name to ensure consistency and professionalism across the platform, though single-name entries are also accepted.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the signup page, **When** they focus on the display name field, **Then** they see a placeholder or help text suggesting "First and Last Name"
2. **Given** a user enters a display name, **When** they submit the form, **Then** the display name is saved with their account
3. **Given** a user leaves the display name field empty, **When** they attempt to submit the signup form, **Then** they see an error indicating the display name is required
4. **Given** a user enters a display name, **When** they complete signup, **Then** their display name appears everywhere they are referenced throughout the platform (profile, huddl listings, comments, attendee lists, etc.)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user enters only a single name (e.g., just "John" without a last name)? System accepts single-name display names as valid.
- What happens when a user enters special characters or emojis in their display name? System accepts all printable characters including emojis and special symbols.
- What happens when a user enters a display name exceeding 70 characters? System must reject the input and display a validation error.
- What happens when multiple users choose the same display name? System allows duplicate display names across users.
- Can users change their display name after signup? Yes, users can freely edit their display name anytime through their profile settings.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST include a display name input field on the signup form
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide visual guidance suggesting users enter their first and last name as the display name
- **FR-003**: System MUST require users to provide a display name before completing signup (field cannot be empty)
- **FR-004**: System MUST store the display name with the user's account information
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate display name input with a maximum length of 70 characters, accept all printable characters including emojis and special symbols, and reject submissions exceeding the length limit
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow non-unique display names (multiple users can share the same display name)
- **FR-007**: System MUST display the user's display name everywhere a user is referenced throughout the platform (including but not limited to: user profile, huddl listings, attendee lists, comments, posts, notifications, and any other user-facing components)
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to edit their display name anytime after signup through their profile settings, with the same validation rules applied (70 character max, all printable characters allowed, non-empty)

### Key Entities
- **User Account**: Represents a registered user on the platform. Key attribute includes display name which serves as the user's visible identifier across the platform. The display name is collected during signup, can be edited anytime by the user, and is stored as part of the user's profile information. Display names are non-unique and accept up to 70 characters of any printable text including emojis and special symbols.
